This file specifies how the OpenCOM-AODV protocol framework can be installed
and executed on Windows XP. I'm currently testing the protocol on Linux. Installation instructions for Linux 
will follow. This protocol uses source code from JADHOC 0.2 from Bremen University under the GNU license.

On Windows
----------
1. Install Java 2 Runtime Environment or SDK (http://java.sun.com)
	Once installed, set the following environment variables,
		set JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk1.4.1_02
		set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%


2. Install WinPcap for Windows (http://winpcap.polito.it/)
	You can use the WinPcap bundled with this version (WinPcap.exe)

	To install run the \tools\WinPcap_4_0.exe

3. Install Jpcap (http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/jpcap/doc/index.html)
	You can use the Jpcap that is bundled with this version (recommended),
	(jpcap-0.5.1) - see \tools\JPCapSetUp.exe

	Running JPCapSetUp.exe will ,

	a) Copy "lib\Jpcap.dll" into "[JRE directory]\bin" or
   		"[JRE directory]\lib\ext\x86"

	b) Copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into "[JRE directory]\lib\ext"

	c) If you installed J2SE SDK, it will copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into
		"[SDK directory]\jre\lib\ext".

	Note: [JRE directory] is usually "C:\Program Files\Java\j2re*".
	      [SDK directory] is usually "C:\j2sdk*".


4. Copy the following  .exe files 
    - EnableRouter.exe
    - IPRoute.exe

   in .\tools directory (where xx is either xp or 2k)
   to the system commands directory specified in the aodv.cfg configuration file.
   (usually, for XP it is C:\Windows\system32 and for Win 2K C:\WINNT\system32).

5. Install OpenCOMJ (OpenCOM v1)


6. Create a project in Eclipse (if you are using Eclipse) and import all the AODV protocol files
	You will also need to import OpenCOMJ classes into the project. Alternatively, you can import all 
      OpenCOMJ source code in a new project which you will include in the AODV project.
	
	Check if the jpcap.jar library is imported into your project as well.


7. Hiding other nodes from the current node
	
	input the MAC addresses of the nodes to hide in the .\macfilter.txt file. Packets from these
	nodes will be filtered and discarded by JPCap



8. Running AODVOverlay

	
	aodv.cfg contains the protocol parameters. Modify these config parameters to suit your environment.
	E.g. you need to change the IP address, default gateway and the network interface 
	
	You can use the .\utils\LstIfc.java program to get the network interface in the following format:
	\Device\NPF_{A06BA48E-A42D-4A12-A5C5-81736F0FCD6F} 
	
	For more details about config file parameters, have a look at
	.\sample-jadhoc.cfg

	The configuration of components needed for WinXP platform is specified in .\aodvwinxp.xml

	the package .\example contains sample code about how to use the AODV framework
