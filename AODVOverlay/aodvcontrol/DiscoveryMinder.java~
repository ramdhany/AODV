/**
* This class defines the thread that managers the route discovery process. A single
* thread gets activated for each request for route discovery. The procedur is as
* follows,
*
*	// retries = 1
*	// sleep-time = NET_TRAVEERSAL_TIME
*	// in loop
*	//	sleep for sleep-time
*	//	check if route has been made (made = route entry AND valid AND not expired)
*	//	if made
*	//		stop thread
*	//	if not made
*	//		retries = retries + 1
*	//		if retries > RREQ_RETRIES
*	//			stop thread
*	//		increment TTL in RREQ by TTL_INCREMENT
*	//		if TTL is now > TTL_THRESHHOLD
*	//			set TTL = NET_DIAMETER
*	//		increment RREQ ID by 1
*	// 		put RREQ ID + originator ip in list for RREQ minder with PATH_DISCOVERY_TIME
*	// 		multicast RREQ
*	//		sleep-time = sleep-time * 2
